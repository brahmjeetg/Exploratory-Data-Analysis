I downloaded the bank customer dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API directly into the Colab Notebook.
The main Task is to predict whether a Customer will leave the credit card services of the bank.
I used the Explaratory Data Analysis Techniques to find out that :
      a) Females are slightly more likely to churn than males
      b) Churn Rate increases as the number of inactive months increases
      c) Total Transaction count and change in the transaction count are the                   first two features with regards to Correlation with target varibale
      d) Customers who have done more than 100 transactions do not churn
